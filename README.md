## Reinforcement Learning using Deep Q-Learning

The idea is to create a deep q-learning algorithm that can generalize and solve most games in OpenAI's Gym.

1) To run this code first install OpenAI's Gym: https://github.com/openai/gym

2) Download this repo and run `python run_carpole.py` to run the agent (or any other game in this repo, like `python run_lunarlander.py`) and see it improve over time.

3) To run a Box2D game like LunarLander you have to install the Box2D Physics engine: `pip install -e '.[box2d]'`
